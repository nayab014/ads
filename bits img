<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Challenge Description:</h3>
<p>
    There are two details on a M*N checkered field. The detail X covers several (at least one first cell) cells in each line.
    The detail Y covers several (at least one last cell) cells. Each cell is either fully covered with a detail or not.
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>
    <img src="assets/fig-1.png" alt="Figure 1">
</p>

<p>
    Also, the details may have cavities (or other complex structures). Please see example below (the detail Y is one detail):
</p>

<p>
  <img src="assets/fig-2.png" alt="Figure 2">
</p>

<p>
    The detail Y starts moving left (without any turn) until it bumps into the X detail at least with one cell.
    Determine by how many cells the detail Y will be moved.
